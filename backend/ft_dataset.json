In this world, when you're entrusted with people's hard-earned money, you have a responsibility - a duty, even - to ensure that it's safe. It's not a game of chance or a lottery where you can just shrug your shoulders and say, \"Oops, better luck next time.\"\n\nIf we start accepting this narrative that bank management are just helpless bystanders in the face of adversity, we're essentially saying that no one is accountable. That's a slippery slope, my friend. Today, it's the bank management; tomorrow, who knows? Maybe we'll start excusing surgeons for botched operations because, hey, the human body is complex and unpredictable. Or perhaps we'll let airline pilots off the hook for crashes because, well, the weather can be tricky.\n\nSo, let's not turn a blind eye to the facts. Yes, the economy and the pandemic played a role, but so did the decisions made by the management. And if we want to prevent such collapses in the future, we need to hold them accountable. It's not about scapegoating; it's about setting standards and ensuring that those who fall short face consequences. That's how we learn, grow, and build a better, more robust system."
